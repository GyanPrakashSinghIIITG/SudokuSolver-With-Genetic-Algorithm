# SudokuSolver-With-Genetic-Algorithm
Genetic Algorithm has been applied to  9x9 sudoku to obtain unique solution. It uses mainly selection,crossover,mutation along with a fitness function to converge to a unique solution.

There are 4 sudoku boards are given. Verified solution for board 1 has also been illustrated.

It has been implemented in python3. Go to directory "SudokuSolver-With-Genetic-Algorithm master" and follow the following steps.


Steps for Running the program-

python sudokuGa.py board1
         or
python sudokuGa.py board2
         or      
python sudokuGa.py board3
         or
python sudokuGa.py board4


some parameters like population size etc. can be changed inside the code itself.
